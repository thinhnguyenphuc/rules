## Prerequisites

### Required Software
- **Flutter SDK**: 3.29.0 (use FVM for version management)
- **Dart SDK**: Included with Flutter
- **Android Studio**: Latest stable version
- **Xcode**: Latest version (macOS only)
- **VS Code**: With Flutter/Dart extensions
- **Git**: Latest version
- **Node.js**: For Husky commit hooks

### Recommended Tools
- **FVM (Flutter Version Management)**: For managing Flutter versions
- **Sourcetree** or **GitKraken**: Git GUI (optional)
- **Postman**: For API testing

---

## Environment Setup

### 1. Install Flutter & FVM
```bash
# Install FVM
dart pub global activate fvm

# Install project Flutter version
fvm install 3.29.0
fvm use 3.29.0

# Verify installation
fvm flutter doctor
```

### 2. Clone Repository
```bash
# Clone the project
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-project-folder>

# Verify you're on develop branch
git branch -a
git checkout develop
```

### 3. Install Project Dependencies
```bash
# Install Melos (monorepo management)
dart pub global activate melos

# Install Husky (commit hooks)
npx husky install

# Install Mason (code generation)
dart pub global activate mason_cli
mason get

# Clean and get all dependencies
melos clean
melos bootstrap
```

---

## Project Setup

### 1. Environment Configuration
The app uses **flavors** for different environments:

- **Stage**: Development/testing environment
- **Production**: Live app environment

Environment variables are managed through `dart-define` and the `Env` class.

### 2. Firebase Setup
Contact the team lead for:
- **Firebase configuration files** (`GoogleService-Info.plist`, `google-services.json`)
- **Environment-specific configs** (stage vs production)

### 3. IDE Configuration
**VS Code** (Recommended):
```bash
# Install recommended extensions
code --install-extension dart-code.flutter
code --install-extension dart-code.dart-code
```

**Android Studio**:
- Install Flutter and Dart plugins
- Configure Android SDK and emulators

---

## Running the App

### 1. Choose Target Device
```bash
# List available devices
fvm flutter devices

# Start iOS simulator
open -a Simulator

# Start Android emulator
emulator -avd your_avd_name
```

### 2. Run Different Flavors

**Stage Environment:**
```bash
# Using VS Code launch configuration
# Select "Stage" from debug dropdown

# Or command line
fvm flutter run --flavor stage --dart-define=FLAVOR=stage
```

**Production Environment:**
```bash
# Select "Production" from debug dropdown

# Or command line  
fvm flutter run --flavor production --dart-define=FLAVOR=production
```

### 3. Build Commands
```bash
# Stage build
make build-android-stage
make build-ios-stage

# Production build
make build-android-production  
make build-ios-production

# Check available make commands
make help
```

---

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create Feature Branch
```bash
# Start from develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/TASK-123-your-feature-name
```

### 2. Make Changes
- Follow the [Coding Conventions](coding_conventions.md)
- Write tests for new features
- Use provided code generation templates

### 3. Commit Changes
```bash
# Stage changes
git add .

# Commit with proper format (enforced by Husky)
git commit -m "[TASK-123] #feat: add awesome new feature"
```

### 4. Create Pull Request
```bash
# Push branch
git push origin feature/TASK-123-your-feature-name

# Create PR in GitLab/GitHub targeting develop
# Use the PR template provided
```

### 5. Code Generation
```bash
# Generate new page
mason make create_page

# Generate new repository
mason make create_repo

# Generate new usecase
mason make create_usecase
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Flutter Doctor Issues
```bash
# Android license not accepted
flutter doctor --android-licenses

# iOS setup issues
sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
sudo xcodebuild -runFirstLaunch
```
